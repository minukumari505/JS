# javascript and classes
 JavaScript Classes exist: JavaScript introduced class syntax in ES6 (2015).
**But they are just syntax sugar over JavaScriptâ€™s existing prototypal inheritance.

## OOP
Object-Oriented Programming is a programming style that is centered around objects, which bundle data (properties) and behavior (methods) together.

## Object
- collection of properties and methods
- toLowerCase

## why use OOP
 Modularity -	Code is divided into logical chunks
 Reusability - Use code in multiple places via inheritance
 Maintainability	- Easier to update and debug
 Encapsulation - Protect and hide internal data
 Polymorphism	- Flexible, cleaner logic
 Scalability - Better for complex, team-based system

## parts of OOP
Object literal 

- Constructor function
- Prototypes
- Classes
- Instances (new, this)


## 4 pillars
Abstraction - Hide internal details, expose only interface
Encapsulation - Hide data inside class
Inheritance - Reuse behavior via parent class
Polymorphism - Same method, different behavior
